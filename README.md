## Interview Practice
Acing the technical rounds is only half the battle. Use the resources below to prepare for the behavioural interviews where recruiters assess your communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.

### 🗣️ Common Behavioural Questions
The key to answering these is to have a few versatile stories about your university projects, coursework, part-time work, and experiences ready to go. You can adapt them to fit the specific question. The goal is to demonstrate your thought process, ownership, and potential.

*   "Tell me about a challenging group project you worked on. How did you handle any difficulties?"
*   "Describe a technical project you're proud of. What was your specific contribution?"
*   "Give an example of a time something didn't go as planned in a project or assignment. How did you handle it?"
*   "Tell me about a time you had to learn something new quickly for a project or coursework."
*   "Describe a situation where you took initiative beyond what was required."
*   "How do you handle feedback from professors, peers, or supervisors?"
*   "What's your biggest accomplishment so far, technical or otherwise?"
*   "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a teammate or had a conflict in a group setting."
*   "Describe a project where the requirements weren't clear initially. How did you move forward?"
*   "Give an example of when you helped a classmate or colleague understand something."
*   "Tell me about a time you had to balance multiple deadlines or priorities."
*   "Why are you interested in this company/role specifically?"

### 💡 Pro-Tips for Behavioural Interviews
1.  **Use the STAR Method**: Structure your answers clearly. It's the industry-standard for a reason.
    *   **S - Situation**: Briefly set the scene and provide context. (e.g., "In my final year group project, our team was building a web application...")
    *   **T - Task**: Describe your specific responsibility or the goal. (e.g., "...and I was responsible for implementing the user authentication system.")
    *   **A - Action**: Detail the steps *you* took. Focus on your individual contribution. Use "I" instead of "we." (e.g., "I researched different authentication methods, chose JWT tokens, implemented the login/signup flow, and...")
    *   **R - Result**: Explain the outcome. Quantify it if possible. (e.g., "As a result, our app successfully handled 100+ test users, we received the highest grade in our cohort, and I gained experience with React and Node.js.")
2.  **Focus on "I", not "We"**: Interviewers need to know what *you* did. It's great that your team succeeded, but they are hiring you, not your team.
3.  **Be Specific**: Avoid vague statements. Instead of "I worked on the frontend," say "I built the user dashboard using React and integrated it with our REST API."

### ✅ CV & Application Tips

> **👉 Get your CV reviewed instantly with [Auralyze.ai's free CV checker](https://auralyze.ai)** – upload your CV and get specific feedback on formatting, content, and ATS optimization before you apply.

1.  **Tailor Your CV**: For each application, update your CV to highlight the skills and experiences that match the job description. Use their keywords.
2.  **Use the X-Y-Z Formula**: For your bullet points, use a structure like: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]." For example: "Improved website load time by 25% (Y) by optimizing image compression in my coursework project (Z), enhancing user experience (X)."
3.  **Keep it to One Page**: Be ruthless. For most student and graduate roles, a single, concise page is all you need.
4.  **Highlight Projects & Coursework**: As a student/new grad, your academic projects, hackathons, and personal coding projects are valuable experience. Treat them seriously.

### 📈 Networking & Tracking
1.  **Use LinkedIn**: Don't just have a profile, use it. Follow target companies, connect with their recruiters, and engage with posts from engineers who work there. A thoughtful comment can go a long way.
2.  **Track Your Applications**: Don't rely on memory. Use a spreadsheet or a free Kanban board tool like Trello or Notion to track every application, its stage (Applied, Online Assessment, Interview, Offer), and dates. This helps you know when to follow up.
