## Interview Practice
Acing the technical rounds is only half the battle. Use the resources below to prepare for the behavioural interviews where recruiters assess your communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.

### 🗣️ Common Behavioural Questions
The key to answering these is to have a few versatile stories about your projects and experiences ready to go. You can adapt them to fit the specific question. The goal is to demonstrate your thought process, ownership, and impact.

*   "Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult team member or stakeholder."
*   "Describe a complex technical project you worked on. What was your specific role and contribution?"
*   "Give an example of a time you faced a major setback or failure. What did you learn from it?"
*   "Walk me through a situation where you had to make a critical decision with incomplete information."
*   "Describe a time you took initiative or went beyond the requirements of a project."
*   "How do you handle constructive criticism or feedback on your work?"
*   "Tell me about your proudest technical achievement."

> **👉 Practice your answers and get instant, AI-powered feedback on your structure, delivery, and clarity with [Auralyze.ai](https://auralyze.ai).**

### 💡 Pro-Tips for Behavioural Interviews
1.  **Use the STAR Method**: Structure your answers clearly. It's the industry-standard for a reason.
    *   **S - Situation**: Briefly set the scene and provide context. (e.g., "In my previous internship, our team was tasked with...")
    *   **T - Task**: Describe your specific responsibility or the goal. (e.g., "...and I was responsible for developing the new authentication service.")
    *   **A - Action**: Detail the steps *you* took. Focus on your individual contribution. Use "I" instead of "we." (e.g., "I designed the API endpoints, wrote the integration tests, and...")
    *   **R - Result**: Explain the outcome. Quantify it if possible. (e.g., "As a result, we reduced login errors by 15% and the feature shipped on time.")
2.  **Focus on "I", not "We"**: Interviewers need to know what *you* did. It's great that your team succeeded, but they are hiring you, not your team.
3.  **Be Specific**: Avoid vague statements. Instead of "I worked on the backend," say "I implemented the caching layer using Redis to decrease database load."
